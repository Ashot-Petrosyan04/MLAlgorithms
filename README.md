19.Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax
Regression (without using Scikit-Learn)
20.Implement a simple linear regression model using gradient descent
algorithm to predict salary given years of experience (data is available on
Moodle), without using Scikit-Learn.
21.Generate a non linear data, and implement a polynomial regression model to
fit the data.
22.Implement multiple linear regression model for house price detection data
available on Moodle using Scikit learn, check for R2 and Adjusted R2. Also
perform data preprocessing, such as feature scaling, hot encoding if needed.
23.Generate linear data with two classes, and create a logistic regression model
using Scikit learn.
24.Generate a non linear data with two classes, and create a logistic regression
model using Scikit learn.
25. Train an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset. Since SVM classifiers are
binary classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-all to classify all 10 digits.
You may want to tune the hyperparameters using small validation sets to
speed up the pro‚Äê cess. What accuracy can you reach?
26. Generate a non-linear data set with two classes. Implement SVM model to
classify this non-linear data set using kernel trick.
