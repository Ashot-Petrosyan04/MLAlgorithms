1.19.Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression (without using Scikit-Learn)

1.20.Implement a simple linear regression model using gradient descent algorithm to predict salary given years of experience (data is available on Moodle), without using Scikit-Learn.

1.21.Generate a non linear data, and implement a polynomial regression model to fit the data.

1.22.Implement multiple linear regression model for house price detection data available on Moodle using Scikit learn, check for R2 and Adjusted R2. Also perform data preprocessing, such as feature scaling, hot encoding if needed.

1.23.Generate linear data with two classes, and create a logistic regression model using Scikit learn.

1.24.Generate a non linear data with two classes, and create a logistic regression model using Scikit learn.

1.25.Train an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset. Since SVM classifiers are binary classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-all to classify all 10 digits. You may want to tune the hyperparameters using small validation sets to speed up the pro‚Äê cess. What accuracy can you reach?

1.26.Generate a non-linear data set with two classes. Implement SVM model to classify this non-linear data set using kernel trick.

2.6.Write your own code in python to implement a neural network to solve a binary classification problem without using Scikit learn. Take a simple neural network with one hidden layer and 2 neurons in it.

2.9.Train a CNN, to classify MNIST digit and compare its performance with deep neural network model.
